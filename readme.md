## History

Once upon a time, somewhere in the Universe, a sixth grader complained in his PE class about how the developers of NFL games had only one year to develop each game.  Then, one of his classmates, who had *some* coding skills, got the idea to create a good game in only one year.  He came up with many ideas about over a few days and decided to name it CastleRun.  He would start by developing it on his Macbook, but then continue the development process on Windows.  So, one day, when he fell ill, he lay on his mother's bed with his Macbook and started developing the game.  Later, he added feature after feature to the game.  After adding features for a while, he decided it was now time to port it to Windows, and tried mingw, cygwin, and watcom, but failed to compile it successfully with any of the compilers.(He didn't try Microsoft Visual Studio because he didn't want to pay for anything.)  This resulted in a 2-year hiatus on the project.  Toward the end of the hiatus, he installed Ubuntu on his PC so he could use gcc and continue development.(For some reason, he didn't go back to his Mac.)  However, due to his laziness, it wasn't until several months later when he offically conitnued the project.
